## TODO List

The following is a list for future work.
- [ ] Improve naming of variables, functions and classes.
- [ ] Modify constructors so that they take `Function` and initial model parameters while creating an instance.
- [ ] Fix number of function evaluations bug for approximate derivatives.
- [ ] Think about a different way of using `objFunc` and `evalObjFunc`. This is related to the decorator pattern in C++.
