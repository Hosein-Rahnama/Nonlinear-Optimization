## Nonlinear Optimization

This is a C++ library for implementing nonlinear optimization algorithms. It mainly focuses on understanding algorithms rather than an improved implementation for better performance. Hopefully, someone who is getting familiar with such algorithms should understand the code withoud any problem.
